# Reload All Tabs in Window
A Firefox addon for reloading all tabs in the current window.

## Motive
I have been unable to find an addon similar to the [Reload All Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reload-all-tabs/lgpdljdpanfecnpindkbnikegohoobci?hl=en) Chrome extension.

I wanted a very simple addon that works for the current window only.
