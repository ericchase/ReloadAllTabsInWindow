# Reload All Tabs in Window
A Firefox addon for reloading all tabs in the current window.

Get the addon here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reload-all-tabs-in-window/

## Motive
~I have been unable to find an addon similar to the [Reload All Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reload-all-tabs/lgpdljdpanfecnpindkbnikegohoobci?hl=en) Chrome extension.~

I must have skipped over [Tab Reloader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabs-reloader/?src=search) while looking for a similar addon. It seems to do exactly what I wanted. Still, this was a good first addon project, and others may use it as a starting point.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this project or suggest enhancements.

Improved icons would be greatly appreciated! The current icon was made by copying the top portion of Firefox's refresh icon. I like the default icons Firefox provides, but my icon doesn't have the same quality.

Don't worry about giving credit, nothing in this project is licensed.
