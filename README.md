# Reload All Tabs in Window

A Firefox addon for reloading all tabs in the current window.  
Get the addon here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reload-all-tabs-in-window/

## Motive

A good first addon project, and may be used as a starting point for other projects.  
I often have the need to refresh all the tabs in a single window. Instead of relying on someone else's addon, I finally decided to make my own.
